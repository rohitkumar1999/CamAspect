 # Smart Security Surveillance System
  ## A centralized system for human identification and tracking.
Person detection and tracking is one of the most important research field that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. There are lot of  surveillance cctv cameras installed around us thus, it is necessary to develop a computer vision based technology that automatically processes the real time video frames in order to track the person.
Here, we aim to build an intelligent system which has its own secure database system, a cctv network and a network of connected nodes(systems). Each node will be connected to the centralized system. Node will be used by authorized personnel with their login credentials for their authorized operations in the system(searching,tagging,etc)
